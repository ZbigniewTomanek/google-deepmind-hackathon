```

## Architecture Rules

These are non-obvious patterns. Violating them breaks the system.

**1. Tools use `MemoryRepository` protocol, never `GraphService` directly.**
Tools get their repo from `ctx.lifespan_context["repo"]`. The protocol (`db/protocol.py`) has two implementations: `InMemoryRepository` (tests) and `GraphServiceAdapter` (production). Read `tools/remember.py` for the canonical pattern.

**2. Dependencies come from lifespan context, not globals.**
```python
repo = ctx.lifespan_context["repo"]        # MemoryRepository
settings = ctx.lifespan_context["settings"] # MCPSettings
agent_id = get_agent_id_from_context(ctx)   # from auth/dependencies.py
```

**3. Multi-graph isolation via PostgreSQL schemas.**
Each agent gets isolated schemas named `ncx_{agent_id}__{purpose}` (double underscore). `GraphRouter` decides routing: store -> personal graph (auto-created), recall -> fan-out across personal + shared, discover -> aggregate all accessible. Shared schemas get RLS; per-agent schemas don't.

**4. All SQL in graph schemas must go through scoped connections.**
`schema_scoped_connection(pool, schema)` for per-agent. `graph_scoped_connection(pool, schema, agent_id)` for shared (adds `SET LOCAL ROLE` for RLS). Schema names validated against `^ncx_[a-z0-9]+__[a-z0-9_]+$`. Use `asyncpg` parameterized queries (`$1`, `$2`) — never string interpolation.

**5. Auth mode determines agent identity.**
`NEOCORTEX_AUTH_MODE`: `none` -> "anonymous", `dev_token` -> from `dev_tokens.json` mapping, `google_oauth` -> OAuth subject. All resolved by `get_agent_id_from_context(ctx)`.

**6. Shared schema access requires explicit permissions.**
`graph_permissions` table controls read/write access per agent per shared schema. `GraphRouter` filters by `can_read`; ingestion validates `can_write`. Admin agents (`is_admin` in `agent_registry`) bypass all permission checks. Bootstrap admin seeded from `NEOCORTEX_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_ID` on every startup. `PermissionChecker` protocol has PG and in-memory implementations. Extraction pipeline carries `target_schema` so nodes/edges land in the correct graph.

**7. Domain routing is additive, not replacing.**
Personal graph extraction continues unchanged. Domain routing adds shared-graph
extraction jobs alongside personal ones. When `target_graph` is explicitly set,
domain routing is skipped (explicit beats automatic). The `ontology_domains` table
maps semantic domains to shared schemas. Classification uses the same Gemini model
as extraction. New domains auto-provision shared schemas and grant write permissions
to the originating agent. Note: "ontology" in `domains/` refers to the upper
ontology (semantic domain categories), distinct from the extraction pipeline's
ontology agent (node/edge type proposals in `extraction/`).

## Observability

Structured logging is a first-class concern. All services use loguru via the central `neocortex/logging.py` module.

**Setup:** Call `setup_logging(service_name="mcp"|"ingestion")` at the top of each entrypoint, before any other code that uses `logger`. The function is idempotent.

**Sinks:** Each service logs to stderr (terminal / Docker) and to a rotating file in `log/` (`log/mcp.log`, `log/ingestion.log`). An additional `log/agent_actions.log` captures structured JSON audit entries from all services.

**Agent action audit trail:** To write to the audit log, bind the `action_log` extra:
```python
from loguru import logger
logger.bind(action_log=True).info("tool_call", tool="remember", agent_id=agent_id, ...)
```
Only messages with `action_log=True` appear in `agent_actions.log`. Use this for every MCP tool invocation and ingestion request.

**Log level:** Controlled by `NEOCORTEX_LOG_LEVEL` env var (default `INFO`). Use `DEBUG` for routing decisions and DB operations; `TRACE` for connection-level detail.

**Pydantic AI agents:** Use lifecycle hooks (`pydantic_ai.capabilities.Hooks`) to log model calls and tool executions to the same `agent_actions.log`. See `docs/plans/05-ingestion-api.md` Stage 9 for the full pattern.

## Scripts

- `scripts/manage.sh` — Unified service & snapshot manager: `start [--fresh]`, `stop [--all]`, `status`, `snapshot save/list/load/delete`. Persist-by-default; `--fresh` wipes and recreates.
- `scripts/run_e2e.sh` — E2E test harness: starts services, runs a test script, tears down on exit.
- `.claude/skills/neocortex/scripts/ingest.sh` — Curl wrapper for all ingestion and admin endpoints. Run with `--help` for usage.

## Skills

- `.claude/skills/neocortex/` — Project skill: DB schema, diagnostic queries, multi-agent setup guide, API endpoints, permissions, debugging playbook, ingestion workflows. Reference files: `DB_SCHEMA.md`, `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, `ENDPOINTS.md`, `PERMISSIONS.md`.
